# Garbage Classification With Webcam Integration

This is a matlab project that used dataset from kaggle to train a model using AlexNet as Trasfer Learning. It was a university project where we had to train a model using transfer learning and get over 80% accuracy. While I was experimenting it, it took long time to train a model so I started saving the model after training. Then I thought why not use that model to classify the garbage from real life itself so I created a script that uses webcam and utilise that saved model to classify the garbage class in real time.
